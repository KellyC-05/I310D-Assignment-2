# Assignment 2: Data Bias

In this project I've learn the use of the perspective API client to estimate the toxic score comparing it to the analysis using python code and find the detail using tables and charts. The data are graph to estimate the toxiced analysis including the bias and misjudgements. From the analysis of severe toxic are mainly with the score that is above 0.923226, where this number founded by the four times of the above average scores. While also used the API to test the data accuracy using a couple words.

Where the dataset tested is number 41297, in my opinion, this comment is not an aggressive text, it just an exaggerate way to express the content. While the score is pretty high with 0.821990. Where I believe there will still have some different understanding of the sentance meaning comparing to the API testing that used by the word detecting.
